broadcasting
C = A + b
- add vect b to wach row of matrix a
hadamard product
- element-wise multiplication of matrices
Inverse Matrices
- only exist if matrix is one-to-one
-- no/infinite solutions possible => no inverse
Column Space (range)
- linear combination of matrix columns
-- n >= m (# cols >= # rows): solution possible
-- redundant columns negate extra columns (same cols 2x2 -> 2x1)
linear independence
- no vector in set can be expressed as linear combo of other vectors in set
-- linear combo: sum of unique scalar mult each thing
- for a matrix to span R^n, req n linearly independent columns
